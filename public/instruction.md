## What is SOJ?
Spartina Online Judge is a coding practice platform for algorithm and programming enthusiasts. After registering an account and login, you can do the following thing:

* Create programming problems and upload input/output test cases.
* Browse all problems and submit your own solution code. The code will be executed and a feedback will be displayed to you in a second. 
* There will also be a submission page that displays all submissions made by all users.
* Browse your own profile page, which contains a list of solved problems and a list of created problems.

## How to browse problems?
Just click on "Problem" tab within the navigation bar. Then you can see a list of all problems. You can click on the ID of the problem to access a specific problem.

## How to submit your solution?
You are required to login in order to submit your code. After login, you can go to a specific problem page (as stated above) and input (or paste) your code into the textarea. After submitting your code, a notification will appear, showing you the judging process. Your submission result will be stored into the database. And you can checkout all submission results by clicking "Submissions" within the navigation bar.

## What the code should be like
Your code must explicitly include all libraries you need. And it must have a main function. For example, you must have ``int main(){}`` in C++ and ``public static void main(String args[])`` in Java. For all problems, you need to use standard input and output to read test data and output your results.

## How to add a problem?
To add a problem, click "My Profile" tab and click "Add Problem" button. You will be required to fill in problem info such as problem ID, title, description, hardness, etc. **The problem ID must be unique**. Conventionally, the problem ID is a combination of capital letters. After adding the problem, **you have to add test cases as following**.

## How to add test cases?
If you have added a problem, you can add test cases for it by clicking "Manage Test Cases" in "My Profile" page. **The test cases cannot be deleted**.
