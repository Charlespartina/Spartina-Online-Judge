#Milestone 2
My research topic is passport. And it hinges on two forms (login and register).
This is a [Form](http://localhost:3000/login/) to Register and Login (You need to open the url after running the app.js). The user info is stored in database. After login, user can view his/her personal profile. Also, user can add problems to the database in profile page.
