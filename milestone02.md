#Milestone 2
My research topic is passport. And it hinges on two forms ([login](http://localhost:3000/login/) and [register](http://localhost:3000/register/)). (You need to open the url after running the app.js).The user info is stored in database. After login, user can view his/her personal [profile](http://localhost:3000/users/). If you are not login, then the profile page shows a notification indicating that you need to login before accessing the profile. Also, user can add problems to the database through profile page.
